Once upon a time there was a UW Madison student who was struggling in some of his classes. 
He was working full time to pay rent and couldn't effectively study in the limited free time 
he was granted. One day in the bleak of winter, a week before finals, he was studying for his
upcoming exams but was struggling. He felt he needed a break, so he walked up to the top
of Bascom and decided to build a snowman in front of the Lincoln Statue. After creating the
snowman, he rubbed Lincoln's foot and wished for success in the upcoming exams. He then left 
the snowman and returned to his apartment to continue studying. The next morning, he heard a 
knock at his door. When he went to look through the peep hole, he saw none other than the 
snowman he'd built the night prior, wearing glasses and holding a snow-laptop.

He took the snowman in and they enjoyed a warm cup of hot cocoa together. the student voiced
his stress to the snowman, who in turn was a great listener. He pulled out his snow-laptop and
stayed for hours helping the student study. Later in the night, they took a study break and
hit State Street for some food.
